# Draft Template for SLAC repositories

This is a proposed template for SLAC software development.  
We hope that this template can be used to encourage best practices in both code organization and SLAC/Stanford collaboration compliance.  
The default state is set to 'private' but we are encouraging open sharing of DOE funded developments with funding attribution and potentially hosting at [OSTI DOE-CODE](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/).  

# SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is operated by Stanford University for the US Departement of Energy.  
[DOE/Stanford Contract](https://legal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Conformed%20Prime%20Contract%20DE-AC02-76SF00515%20as%20of%202022.10.01.pdf)

# Lisence

We are beginning with the BSD-2 lisence but this is an open discussion between code authors, SLAC management, and DOE program managers along the funding line for the project.
